# DVImport-DateFixer
A simple script which fixes the dates in metadata on imports from MiniDV through iMovie,
it only detects .mp4 and .m4v files because I run them through HandBrake,
i'll work on it and make it into a universal Date & Time fixer on videos/photos which have them in their file name.
